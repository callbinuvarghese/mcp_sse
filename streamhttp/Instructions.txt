Query: Get weather alerts for Georgia

I'll help you get the weather alerts for Georgia using the `get_alerts` function. Since the function requires a two-letter state code, I'll use "GA" for Georgia.
[Calling tool get_alerts with args {'state': 'GA'}]
I have checked and there are currently no active weather alerts for the state of Georgia.

For the most up-to-date weather alerts, you can always check:
- The National Weather Service website (weather.gov)
- Your local weather station
- Weather apps on your mobile device

Query: ^C

Query: How can you help

I can help you with several things using the available tools:

1. Database Queries:
- I can show you what tables are in the database
- I can describe the structure of specific tables
- I can run SELECT queries to get data from the database

2. Weather Information:
- I can get weather alerts for any US state (using the two-letter state code)
- I can get weather forecasts for specific locations (when provided with latitude and longitude coordinates)

Let me know what specific information you'd like to see! For example, I can:
- Show you the available database tables
- Get weather alerts for a specific state
- Get a weather forecast for a location (would need coordinates)
- Query specific data from the database

What would you like to know more about?

Query: Show tables

I'll help you list all the tables in the database using the `list_tables` function.
[Calling tool list_tables with args {}]
It looks like there might be some formatting issues in your message. From what I can see, you have three tables:

1. orders
2. products
3. users

And there seems to be a reference to "sqlite_sequence" which is a system table in SQLite databases.

Would you like to know more about any of these tables or would you like to perform any specific operations with them?
